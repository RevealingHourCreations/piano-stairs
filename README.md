======


#### Installation
Clone this repo and run install.sh

	git clone http://github.com/anujdeshpande/piano-stairs.git
	chmod +x install.sh
	./install.sh

### amsynth
Why do we install amsynth from source instead of using the package
manager ? Because we can't run it in headless mode unless we have the
latest source code

### Using amsynth(headless) and pygame.midi
TBD

### vkeybd with amsynth (needs X environment)
TBD

### ttymidi with Arduino acting as a midi device
TBD
